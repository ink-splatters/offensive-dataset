## Disclaimer: No License Provided by the Upstream

This repository includes a compressed version of the "Offensive Humor" dataset, originally available at [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/datasets/metaeval/offensive-humor).

As of the date of this repository's creation, the dataset does not have an explicit license. The absence of a license implies that it is effectively "all rights reserved."

The usage of the dataset must align with the [ðŸ¤— general Terms of Service](https://huggingface.co/terms), though these do not replace the need for a dataset-specific license.

### Denial of Liability

The author of this fork made it solely for his own convenience and solely for personal, non-commercial purposes.

They explicitly disclaim any responsibility for, or liability regarding, third parties' use of the provided dataset, including for personal, non-commercial purposes, emphasizing that users bear the sole and full responsibility for, and liability in regard to, their actions.

It's reasonable to assume that merely compressing the upstream dataset doesn't constitute a derivative work that would be prohibited by the "all rights reserved" clause, so it's probably legal. However, this is not legal advice.

Instead, use at your own risk and ensure your usage complies with applicable laws and regulations.
